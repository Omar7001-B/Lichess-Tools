# Lichess Analysis Board Automation

This Tampermonkey script automates the process of requesting a computer analysis on Lichess after finishing a game. It saves you the manual steps of opening the analysis board and clicking the request analysis button, making your post-game analysis more convenient.

## How to Use

1. Install a userscript manager extension in your web browser. Tampermonkey is a popular choice and is available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other browsers.
2. Download the Tampermonkey script file (lichess-analysis-automation.js) and save it on your computer.
3. Open the Tampermonkey dashboard, go to the "Utilities" tab, and import the script file.
4. Visit Lichess and start playing a game.
5. After finishing a game, the analysis board will automatically open, and the "Request a computer analysis" button will be clicked. The analysis will be initiated, and you can view the results once it's completed.

Note: This script assumes you are using the default settings on Lichess. If there are any changes to the Lichess website layout or functionality, the script may need to be updated accordingly.

## Compatibility

This script has been tested and verified to work on the Lichess website with the Tampermonkey extension. It should be compatible with major web browsers that support Tampermonkey or similar userscript managers.
