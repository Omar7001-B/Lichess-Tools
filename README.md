# Lichess Enhancement Scripts

Welcome to the Lichess Enhancement Scripts repository! This collection of JavaScript scripts is designed to enhance your playing experience on Lichess.org, a popular online chess platform. Each script provides a unique functionality to improve various aspects of your gameplay. You can find detailed descriptions and usage instructions for each script below.

## Scripts

### [Switch Pieces Script](./Switch-Piece-Set)
This script is a userscript that allows you to show or hide chess pieces on the Lichess board with a single key press. It provides a convenient way to customize your board appearance according to your preferences.

### [Lichess Chess Board Time Alert](./Lichess-Time-Alert)
The Lichess Chess Board Time Alert script is a Tampermonkey script that adds a red color filter to the chessboard on Lichess when your bottom clock time is less than the top clock time. This visual cue serves as a time alert, helping you stay aware of your time management during games.

### [Lichess Analysis Board Automation](./Lichess-Analysis-Board-Automation)
This Tampermonkey script automates the process of requesting a computer analysis on Lichess after finishing a game. It saves you the manual steps of opening the analysis board and clicking the request analysis button, making your post-game analysis more convenient and efficient.

## Installation

To use these scripts, you'll need a userscript manager extension like Tampermonkey installed in your browser. Once you have the extension installed, follow the instructions below to install and enable the desired scripts:

1. Navigate to the script's folder by clicking on the script name above.
2. Open the script file (ends with `.user.js` extension).
3. Click the "Raw" button at the top right of the script file to view the raw code.
4. Tampermonkey should detect the script and open its installation page.
5. Review the script code and click the "Install" button to enable the script.
6. The script will now be active on Lichess. Refresh the page if necessary.
